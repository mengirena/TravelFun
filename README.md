## How it's built

**Tech used**: ReactJS, CSS

## Lesson Learnt

### `window` get the viewport size & trigger event while resizing

`window.addEventListener('resize', showButton)`

### When do we use object-fit

It's for to set a replaced element such as an `<img>`, `<video>` or `<iframe>` tag to fit its container. 

### Differernce between Drop Shadow and Box Shadow

1. Drop shadow doesnt' follow box-model so it will ignore the transparent area and really reveal the shape in some cases. 

2. The claculation of the spread of the radius in these two cases are differernt.
